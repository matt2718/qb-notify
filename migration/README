So, I occasionally need to change the DB schema when adding new features. The
scripts in here allow you to migrate the DB to new versions. You should run them
in order, starting with the number corresponding to your current schema.
Obviously, you should back up the DB before attempting to migrate.

Perhaps I should have used NoSQL (it would probably get me some street cred),
but Flask has great SQL integration and I was lazy.

List of the changes for each migration script:
